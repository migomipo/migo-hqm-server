# Migo HQM Server

This is my own HQM server implementation. It attempts to recreate the physics as accurately as possible, while adding some features and bug fixes. Most notably, it fixes the goal detection glitch, allows for multiple pucks in warmups, has a completely revamped offside+icing implementation, server-side ping and some administrator features. Performance may also be slightly better and more consistent.

## How to start

You will need a configuration file to start, a default config.ini is provided. 

Run `migo-hqm-server` to start the server with config.ini in the current working directory, or `migo-hqm-server <path-to-config>` to run with any compatible configuration file in your system.

## How to configure

config.ini is a good starting point, and contains the important available settings. It is divided into three sections.

### Server

Property               | Explanation
-----------------------| -------------
name                   | Name of the server that will be visible in the server list
port                   | Port number, must be a number between 0 and 65535. 27585 is the default, and most servers are in the 27585-27599 range.
mode                   | Game mode. Currently supported values are "match" (play matches), "warmup" (warmup mode forever), "russian" (Russian 1v1/2v2), and "shootout" (shootout mode).
public                 | If true, the server will notify the master server so that clients can find this server easily in the server list.
public_address         | (optional) Master server address.
log_name               | (optional) Log name prefix. Log files will end up in a "log" folder in the current working directory, and be named *log_name*-*date*. Default log name prefix is the server name + ".log".
team_max               | Number of players allowed in each team.
player_max             | Number of players allowed in the server.
password               | Administrator password.
welcome                | Welcome message that is sent to all players when they're joining. \n will create a new line. The client can only show 7 chat lines at a time, and it is not recommended to have more than three lines.
replays                | (optional) If true, all matches that start will be saved as replays. Games that ended before the warmup ended will not be saved.
service                | Service name for Linux based systems. Command /serverrestart for restarting the service.      
replay_endpoint        | If configured (and replays are enabled), the server will send the replay data as a HTTP POST request (multipart form) to the given URL when matches end.
extended_chat          | If true, the server will send messages to chat whenever player joins the team or spectators.
