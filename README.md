# Migo HQM Server

This is my own HQM server implementation. It attempts to recreate the physics as accurately as possible, while adding some features and bug fixes. Most notably, it fixes the goal detection glitch, allows for multiple pucks in warmups, has a completely revamped offside+icing implementation, server-side ping and some administrator features. Performance may also be slightly better and more consistent.

## How to start

You will need a configuration file to start, a default config.ini is provided. 

Run `migo-hqm-server` to start the server with config.ini in the current working directory, or `migo-hqm-server <path-to-config>` to run with any compatible configuration file in your system.

## How to configure

config.ini is a good starting point, and contains the important available settings. It is divided into two sections.

### Server

Property               | Explanation
-----------------------| -------------
name                   | Name of the server that will be visible in the server list
port                   | Port number, must be a number between 0 and 65535. 27585 is the default, and most servers are in the 27585-27599 range.
mode                   | If set to "warmup", this will be a warmup server and matches will never start.
public                 | If true, the server will notify the master server so that clients can find this server easily in the server list.
log_name               | (optional) Log name prefix. Log files will end up in a "log" folder in the current working directory, and be named *log_name*-*date*. Default log name prefix is the server name + ".log".
team_max               | Number of players allowed in each team.
player_max             | Number of players allowed in the server.
force_team_size_parity | (optional) If true, players will not be able to join the team that already has more players than the other one. Default value is false.
password               | Administrator password.
welcome                | Welcome message that is sent to all players when they're joining. \n will create a new line. The client can only show 7 chat lines at a time, and it is not recommended to have more than three lines.
replays                | (optional) If true, all matches that start will be saved as replays. Games that ended before the warmup ended will not be saved.               

### Game

Property               | Explanation
-----------------------| -------------
spawn                  | Spawn point for players who join a team. Allowed values are "center" (default, spawns players at the center faceoff circle) and "bench" (spawns players right next to the "bench", opposite side of the spectator camera)
limit_jump_speed       | If true, nerfs jump speed, effectively nerfing double-jumping. If false, it should work like vanilla.
offside                | Offside setting. Allowed values are "off" (default, no offside), "on", (offside rule enabled) and "immediate", which will call offside immediately instead of warning when the puck has entered the offensive zone in an offside situation.
icing                  | Icing setting. Allowed values are "off" (default, no icing), "on" (touch icing rule enabled) and "notouch" (no-touch icing rule enabled)
time_period            | Period length in seconds.
time_warmup            | Warmup length in seconds.
time_intermission      | Intermission length in seconds.
warmup_pucks           | Number of pucks in warmup. Only 32 objects (pucks+players) are allowed on the ice at the time, so at warmup there can never be more players than (32 minus number of pucks) on the ice.
mercy                  | Mercy rule setting. If 0, mercy rule will be disabled. Otherwise, games will automatically end if a team scores and leads by at least X goals.
first                  | First-to-goals rule setting. If 0, first-to-goals rule will be disabled. Otherwise, games will automatically end if a team scores and and reaches at least X goals scored.
